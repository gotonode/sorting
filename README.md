# A collection of sorting algorithms implemented in Java

Included algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Counting Sort
- Heapsort
- Insertion Sort
- JavaSort (internal)
- Merge Sort
- Quicksort
- SelectionSort

You can either test the speeds of all of the algorithms at once, or test a single algorithm multiple times.

First, an array of integers is created in one of four different ways:
- integers in pseudorandom order, ex. [2, 0, 1]
- integers in ascending order, ex. [0, 1, 2]
- integers in descending order, ex [2, 1, 0]
- no fill (by default, the array will be full of zeros), ex. [0, 0, 0]

When you run the app, you are asked for an exponent. We'll raise 10 to this exponent to determine the size of the array (of integers) that will be created. For an example, if you choose 6, your array will have 10^6 = 1,000,000 integers.

Feel free to copy and use the algorithms in your own projects.
